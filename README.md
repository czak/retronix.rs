# retronix.rs

Retronix.rs is a simple [Xonix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xonix) clone for the terminal, and my first voyage into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

For a more elaborate, cross-platform version in Java, see [http://retronix.czak.pl](http://retronix.czak.pl).

## How to run

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/czak/retronix.rs.git
$ cd retronix.rs
$ cargo run
```

Tested with Rust stable 1.24.1.

## About the game

Use the cursor keys to control the player (the magenta block).
Your goal is to fill the board, while avoiding the enemies.
Fill 80% and you advance to the next level. Every level brings more enemies.
Enjoy!
